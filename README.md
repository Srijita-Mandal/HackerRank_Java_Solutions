# HackerRank_Java_Solutions

I have started to learn Java one week ago and trying to solve problems besides learning. So, currently I am doing my practice on HackerRank. I take an attempt to upload the solutions of the problems, done by me, on Github. I am trying to make successive contributions on github to be more engaged and enthusiast with solving problems.

I am starting with the easiest problem *to print "Hello World"* :)

Hope I can solve standard and advanced problems in near future :)
